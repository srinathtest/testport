The incoming video stream was taken from a camera and passed through the model and the model will predict drowsy if driver’s eyes are closed and predicts Not_drowsy if his eyes are open. If the eyes of the driver are detected to be closed for 7 successive frames or for 5 seconds in the incoming video stream the proposed system would declare the driver to be drowsy, and an alarm will be generated to wake up the driver. This is done to prevent accidents at high speeds because in such situations a few seconds of carelessness can result in a fatal accident. Achieved an accuracy of 88.9%.
